    "# Word Embedding\n",
    "- Word embedding in NLP is an important term that is used for representing words for text analysis in the form of real-valued vectors. It is an advancement in NLP that has improved the ability of computers to understand text-based content in a better way. It is considered one of the most significant breakthroughs of deep learning for solving challenging natural language processing problems.\n",

    "Word2Vec is a method to create word embeddings that map words into high-dimensional vectors. It captures semantic meanings by placing words with similar meanings close to each other in the vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Converts text into numerical format for NLP tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and more.\n",
    "- **Approach**: Shallow neural networks learn word relationships based on their contexts in a large text corpus.\n",
